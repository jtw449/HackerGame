# Hacker Game

A game developed with C++ that allows players to play the actions of
an elusive computer hacker. This project is being developed for the
Software Engineering course at the University of Missouri. The engineering
is being performed iteratively and incrementally in adherence to
[Scrum](https://www.scrum.org) methodologies.

## Project Information

Our original idea for this project was to create a hacking game that would allow
players to learn UNIX and virtually hack servers. The scope of our project turned
out to be far greater than originally anticipated - a great lesson in estimating!
We therefore decided to PIVOT to a simpler design of a virtual terminal.

We implemented a virtual UNIX terminal on top of a real UNIX terminal. A lot of common
commands such as 'mv', 'cp', and 'ls' and have been recreated to work with our
custom classes.

This foundation that we have created leads to a plethora of possibilities that we
hope to explore in the future. We will continue working together down the road
to hopefully put together our original goal. Overall, this project acquainted our
team with the Scrum methodology. The project occurred over 5 week-long sprints.
Without following the iterative and incremental approaches of our Agile process, it would not
have been possible for us to complete this project.
