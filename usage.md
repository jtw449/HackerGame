Upon launching the program (HackerGame), you will be prompted to create your player account.
Enter a username and password, and you're all set!

At this point you have a virtual UNIX terminal under your control. You will be
in the root directory to start. Use the following commands to manipulate your
terminal:

* cd <absolute path>
** Changes the current working directory to the specified path
* ls <absolute path>
** Lists the contents of the specified path
* cat <absolute path>
** Print the contents of the file contained at the end of the absolute path
* touch <absolute path>
** Updates the last access time of the specified path
* mkdir <absolute path>
** Creates a new, empty directory at the end of the specified path
* rm <absolute path>
** Deletes the item contained at the end of the specified path
* clear <absolute path>
** Clears the terminal screen
